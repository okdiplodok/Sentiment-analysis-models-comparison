When you poke at such a project you generally, in my experience, find the "why" doesn't have a good or coherent answer.

Standard discs. Based on the miles they've covered and how you drive your dealership really should look at the calipers and the pads to make sure there's no faults.

We read about 300 reports of innovation each year as part of @Charity_Awards and almost all of the good stuff is coming from small-to-medium charities.	https://twitter.com/daveainsworth4/status/1052877242156474368		UK	neu
One issue is about the lack of innovation in large companies - lots of research on this - & whether that is true for charities. If so, stasis of large is bad. I think there is (scruffy, incomplete) evidence that innovation comes from smaller charities, as happens with companies.	https://twitter.com/daveainsworth4/status/1052877242156474368		UK	neu
No, totally agreed (have seen people present this as both a positive & a negative!) BUT think stability & lack of change interesting re: 1.) ‘birth rate’ 2.) how orgs in the social economy are capitalised 3.) why this means the ‘birth rate’ is as low by comparison	https://twitter.com/daveainsworth4/status/1052877242156474368		UK	neu
I’ve seen opinion pieces that do things like show the 10 biggest companies, 20 years apart, to show they are vastly different - and then do the same for charities and show no change. I dont think that proves what people want to say, but these sorts of trends are of interest!	https://twitter.com/daveainsworth4/status/1052877242156474368		UK	neu
If many of the charities start in 1961 that means average age is wildly different from other forms. Am now interested in this number. We could definitely do a piece on it.	https://twitter.com/daveainsworth4/status/1052877242156474368		UK	neu
Ha, yes that would complicate a straight calculation. Completely agree though that these kinds of basic stats would be very useful. Not least since funding goes in waves (will recent interest in start ups lead to longer lasting orgs than avg?).	https://twitter.com/daveainsworth4/status/1052877242156474368		UK	neu
There’s definitely churn - about 5000 are removed every year. But average age I dont know. I think we can calculate that, though it would need quite a bit of detective work (problem is large % will have a born date of 1961, when the register started)	https://twitter.com/daveainsworth4/status/1052877242156474368		UK	neu
Do charities? I assume Karl will know!	https://twitter.com/daveainsworth4/status/1052877242156474368		UK	neu
I trust Ged’s maths! Worth looking at longevity in thinking about this. The average age of companies on the register is 8 yrs (is that right, Ged?), so even if annual births and deaths are a little hard to calculate, there must be plenty of churn or that number would be higher.	https://twitter.com/daveainsworth4/status/1052877242156474368		UK	neu
New #coops seem to run at c. 250 p/a in the UK (including conversions?) with some spikes in e.g. employee ownership numbers in Scotland in rcent years, so seems about right (but ask Gen is my maths and / or understanding of the data is broadly correct)	https://twitter.com/daveainsworth4/status/1052877242156474368		UK	neu
- Private limited companies account for c. 96% of all corporate body types on the register - During 2017/18, there were 620,285 incorporations in total - So between several hundred and few thousand is what we are looking at for CLGs per annum?	https://twitter.com/daveainsworth4/status/1052877242156474368		UK	neu
- 42,174 Guarantee Companies with exemption from using 'Ltd / Limited' (many of these will probably have Registered Charity status, I'd guess?) - that's 1% of the register - & 105,092 Guarantee Companies - that's c. 2.5% of the total register	https://twitter.com/daveainsworth4/status/1052877242156474368		UK	neu
@nicktemple1 you could take a rough stab at the 'birth rate' of similar organisation Karl (have been doing something on this with @My_impact_is recently... watch this space) .. but - There are over 23 types of corporate body held on the register	https://twitter.com/daveainsworth4/status/1052877242156474368		UK	neu
Yes, I’ve heard many say that. I’d love to get some stats on the number of companies ltd by guarantee, with a social purpose, for the same year.	https://twitter.com/daveainsworth4/status/1052877242156474368		UK	neu
4/ We're also often told that for people who want to do social useful things, there are other options to the crusty old model of charity - with its over-regulation and old-hat governance model. But look at CICs - 2,844 established last year. Half number of charity applications.	https://twitter.com/daveainsworth4/status/1052877242156474368		UK	neu
3/ First, it feels sometimes like people don't like the charity model anymore: trust falling is a common narrative. But this suggests something different (as do the figures for the total income of registered charities, which goes up every year). People still believe in charity.	https://twitter.com/daveainsworth4/status/1052877242156474368		UK	neu
2/ There’s also some stats in there about how long it takes (50-odd days; its getting quicker). But I really think that increase in applications to register a charity is a thing. A couple of reasons.	https://twitter.com/daveainsworth4/status/1052877242156474368		UK	neu
1/ The Charity Commission has just written to parliament to say that the number of applications to register a charity has increased by 40% in 5 years. 40%. So last year, there were 8,375 applications to register a charity.	https://twitter.com/daveainsworth4/status/1052877242156474368		UK	neu
