# Sentiment-analysis-models-comparison
The following repository contains the code that I used for an internship research. In this research I compared different sentiment analysis models on Twitter data.

The data for testing the models and the training corpus for Naive Bayes, SVM, and NBSVM are located in the `\data` folder.

The Jupyter notebook file contains the code needed to replicate my results along with my comments.
